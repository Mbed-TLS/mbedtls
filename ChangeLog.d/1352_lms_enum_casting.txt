Bugfix
   * Fix a sloppy check in LMS public key import, which could lead to accepting
     keys with a different LMS or LM-OTS types on some platforms. Specifically,
     this could happen on platforms where enum types are smaller than 32 bits
     and compiler optimization is enabled. Found and reported by Linh Le and
     Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
