Features
   * MD module can now perform PSA dispatching also when
     `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT && !MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C`, even though this
     configuration is not officially supported. This requires that a
     PSA Crypto provider library which:
     * supports the required `PSA_WANT_ALG_xxx` and
     * implements `psa_can_do_hash()` on the client interface
     is linked against Mbed TLS and that `psa_crypto_init()` is called before
     performing any PSA call.
