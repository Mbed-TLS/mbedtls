   * Fix a buffer underrun in mbedtls_pk_write_key_der() when
     called on an opaque key, MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled,
     and the output buffer is smaller than the actual output.
     Fix a related buffer underrun in mbedtls_pk_write_key_pem()
     when called on an opaque RSA key, MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled
     and MBEDTLS_MPI_MAX_SIZE is smaller than needed for a 4096-bit RSA key.
