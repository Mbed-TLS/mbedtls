Bugfix
   * Fix a race condition on x86/amd64 platforms in AESNI support detection
     that could lead to using software AES in some threads at the very
     beginning of a multithreaded program. Reported by Solar Designer.
     Fixes #9840.

Security
   * On x86/amd64 platforms, with some compilers, when the library is
     compiled with support for both AESNI and software AES and AESNI is
     available in hardware, an adversary with fine control over which
     threads make progress in a multithreaded program could force software
     AES to be used for some time when the program starts. This could allow
     the adversary to conduct timing attacks and potentially recover the
     key. In particular, this attacker model may be possible against an SGX
     enclave.
