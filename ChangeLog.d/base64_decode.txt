Bugfix
   * Fix mbedtls_base64_decode() on inputs that did not have the correct
     number of trailing equal signs, or had 4*k+1 digits. They were accepted
     as long as they had at most two trailing equal signs. They are now
     rejected. Furthermore, before, on inputs with too few equal signs, the
     function reported the correct size in *olen when it returned
     MBEDTLS_ERR_BASE64_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, but truncated the output to the
     last multiple of 3 bytes.
