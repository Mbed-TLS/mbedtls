Bugfix
   * Ensure hashlen is suitable for given md_alg in pk verify and sign
     functions. To avoid buffer over/under reads and writes, a check is made
     on hashlen to ensure that, if not zero, it is equal to the expected
     length of the md_alg's digest. If the length is 0 then the hash can be
     assumed by using the length associated with the md_alg.
