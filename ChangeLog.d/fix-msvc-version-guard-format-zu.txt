Bugfix
   * Fix definition of MBEDTLS_PRINTF_SIZET to prevent runtime crashes that
     occurred whenever SSL debugging was enabled on a copy of Mbed TLS built
     with Visual Studio 2013 or MinGW.
     Fixes #10017.
   * Remove Everest Visual Studio 2010 compatibility headers, which could
     interfere with standard CRT headers in certain situations, eg. when
     building Mbed TLS with the .sln file shipped with the project.
