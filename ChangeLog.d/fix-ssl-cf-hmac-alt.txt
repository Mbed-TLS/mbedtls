Bugfix
   * Fix a regression introduced in 2.16.8 which broke (D)TLS CBC ciphersuites
     (when the encrypt-then-MAC extension is not in use) with some ALT
     implementations of the underlying hash (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384), causing
     the affected side to wrongly reject valid messages. Fixes #4118.
