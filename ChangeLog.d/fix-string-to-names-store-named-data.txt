   * Fix a bug in mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() and the
     mbedtls_x509write_{crt,csr}_set_{subject,issuer}_name() functions,
     where some inputs would cause an inconsistent state to be reached, causing
     a NULL dereference either in the function itself, or in subsequent
     users of the output structure, such as mbedtls_x509_write_names(). This
     only affects applications that create (as opposed to consume) X.509
     certificates, CSRs or CRLs. Found by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
     CVE-2025-48965
