API changes
   * The interface of the GCM module has changed to remove restrictions on
     how the input to multipart operations is broken down. mbedtls_gcm_finish()
     now takes an extra output parameter for the last partial output block.
     mbedtls_gcm_update() now takes extra parameters for the output length.
     The software implementation always produces the full output at each
     call to mbedtls_gcm_update(), but alternative implementations activated
     by MBEDTLS_GCM_ALT may delay partial blocks to the next call to
     mbedtls_gcm_update() or mbedtls_gcm_finish(). Furthermore, applications
     no longer pass the associated data to mbedtls_gcm_starts(), but to the
     new function mbedtls_gcm_update_ad().
     These changes are backward compatible for users of the cipher API.

Features
   * The multi-part GCM interface (mbedtls_gcm_update() or
     mbedtls_cipher_update()) no longer requires the size of partial inputs to
     be a multiple of 16.
