Features
   * Added `mbedtls_ssl_export_traffic_keys()` to derive and export traffic
     keys and IVs for both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 sessions. This enables
     integration with Linux Kernel TLS (KTLS) by exposing the keying
     material required for kernel-level record encryption and decryption.
   * Added `mbedtls_ssl_get_sequence_numbers()` to retrieve the current
     inbound and outbound record-layer sequence numbers, enabling
     user-space KTLS implementations to construct per-record nonces.

Changes
   * Moved `struct mbedtls_ssl_key_set` to `ssl.h` to make it publicly
     accessible for applications needing traffic key and IV information.
   * Declared `ssl_tls13_get_cipher_key_info()` in `ssl_tls13_keys.h`
     for use by external modules requiring cipher key and IV length
     information.
   * Added dedicated tests for `mbedtls_ssl_export_traffic_keys()`,
     covering both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 ciphersuites.
   * Added a new `ssl/ktls.c` example demonstrating KTLS integration
     with Mbed TLS, including traffic key export, sequence number
     retrieval, and socket-level key installation.
