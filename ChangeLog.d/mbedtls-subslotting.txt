Changes
   * Add option `ENABLE_SLOTTED_VERSION` to CMake project that adds version
     suffix for cmake and pkg-config files (#8723, disabled by default). This
     allows to install major versions of MbedTLS simultaneously.
     Dependent packages should use `find_package(MbedTLS 3 [REQUIRED])` and
     `MbedTLS::<component>` in order to use requested libraries.
     Packages that relies on pkg-config output, should use
     `pkg-config --libs --cflags (mbedtls-3|mbedx509-3|mbedx509-3)` output in
     order to discover actual library names and include paths.
