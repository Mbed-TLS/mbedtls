Changes
   * Add version suffix for cmake and pkg-config files (#8723). This allows
     to install major versions of MbedTLS simultaneously.
     Dependent packages should use `find_package(MbedTLS 3 [REQUIRED])` and
     `MbedTLS::<component>` in order to use requested libraries.
     Packages that relies on pkg-config output, should use
     `pkg-config --libs --cflags (mbedtls3|mbedx5093|mbedx5093)` output in
     order to discover actual library names and include paths.
