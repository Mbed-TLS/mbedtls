Removals
   * The library no longer offers interfaces to look up values by OID
     or OID by enum values.
     The header <mbedtls/oid.h> now only defines functions to convert
     between binary and dotted string OID representations, and macros
     for OID strings that are relevant to X.509.
     The compilation option MBEDTLS_OID_C no longer
     exists. OID tables are included in the build automatically as needed.
