Features
   * Added new configuration option MBEDTLS_PSA_STATIC_KEY_SLOTS, which
     uses static storage for keys, enabling malloc-less use of key slots.
     The size of each buffer is given by the option
     MBEDTLS_PSA_STATIC_KEY_SLOT_BUFFER_SIZE. By default it accommodates the
     largest PSA key enabled in the build.
