   * Fix a stack buffer overflow in mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw() and
     mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der() when the bits parameter is larger than the
     largest supported curve. In some configurations with PSA disabled,
     all values of bits are affected. This never happens in internal library
     calls, but can affect applications that call these functions directly.
