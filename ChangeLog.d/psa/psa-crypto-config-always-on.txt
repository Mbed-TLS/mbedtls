Default behavior changes
   * The `PSA_WANT_XXX` symbols as defined in
     tf-psa-crypto/include/psa/crypto_config.h are now always used in the
     configuration of the cryptographic mechanisms exposed by the PSA API.
     This corresponds to the configuration behavior of Mbed TLS 3.x when
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG is enabled. In effect, MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG
     is now always enabled and the configuration option has been removed.
