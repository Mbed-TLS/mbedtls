API changes
   * When building the library as a PSA client (MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT
     enabled and MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C disabled), you need to provide the
     function psa_can_do_cipher() in addition to psa_can_do_hash(). This
     changed was made in Mbed TLS 3.6.0 but was not announced then.
