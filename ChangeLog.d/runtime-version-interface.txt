API changes
   * Change the signature of the runtime version information methods that took
     a char* as an argument to take zero arguments and return a const char*
     instead. This aligns us with the interface used in TF PSA Crypto 1.0.
     If you need to support linking against both Mbed TLS 3.x and 4.x, please
     use the build-time version macros or mbedtls_version_get_number() to
     determine the correct signature for mbedtls_version_get_string() and
     mbedtls_version_get_string_full() before calling them.
     Fixes issue #10308.
