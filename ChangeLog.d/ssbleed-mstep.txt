Security
   * Fix a local timing side-channel in modular inversion and GCD that was
     exploitable in RSA key generation and other RSA operations (see the full
     advisory for details), allowing a local attacker to fully recover the
     private key. This can be exploited on some Arm-v9 CPUs by an unprivileged
     attacker running code on the same core (SSBleed), or when Trustzone-M is
     used, by the non-secure side abusing timer interrupts (M-Step), and
     probably in other similar settings as well. Found and reported
     independently by: SSBleed: Chang Liu (Tsinghua University) and Trevor E.
     Carlson (National University of Singapore); M-Step: Cristiano Rodrigues
     (University of Minho), Marton Bognar (DistriNet, KU Leuven), Sandro Pinto
     (University of Minho), Jo Van Bulck (DistriNet, KU Leuven). CVE-2025-54764
