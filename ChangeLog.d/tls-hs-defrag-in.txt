Bugfix
   * Support re-assembly of fragmented handshake messages in TLS, as mandated
     by the spec. Lack of support was causing handshake failures with some
     servers, especially with TLS 1.3 in practice (though both protocol
     version could be affected in principle, and both are fixed now).
     The initial fragment for each handshake message must be at least 4 bytes.

     Server-side, defragmentation of the ClientHello message is only
     supported if the server accepts TLS 1.3 (regardless of whether the
     ClientHello is 1.3 or 1.2). That is, servers configured (either
     at compile time or at runtime) to only accept TLS 1.2 will
     still fail the handshake if the ClientHello message is fragmented.
