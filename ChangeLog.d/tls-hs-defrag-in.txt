Bugfix
   * Support re-assembly of fragmented handshake messages in TLS, as mandated
     by the spec. Lack of support was causing handshake failures with some
     servers, especially with TLS 1.3 in practice (though both protocol
     version could be affected in principle, and both are fixed now).
