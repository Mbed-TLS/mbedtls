Bugfix
   * Fix failures of PSA multipart or interruptible operations when the
     library is built with a compiler where "union foo x = {0}" does not
     initialize non-default members of the union, such as GCC 15 and
     some versions of Clang 18. This affected MAC multipart operations,
     MAC-based key derivation operations, interruptible signature,
     interruptible verification, and potentially other operations when
     using third-party drivers. This also affected one-shot MAC operations
     using the built-in implementation. Fixes #9814.
