README for Mbed TLS
===================

Mbed TLS is a C library that implements X.509 certificate manipulation and the TLS and DTLS protocols. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems.
Mbed TLS includes the [TF-PSA-Crypto repository](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/TF-PSA-Crypto) that provides an implementation of the [PSA Cryptography API](https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api).

Configuration
-------------
Configuration options related to X.509 and TLS are available in `include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h`, while cryptography and platform options are located in the TF-PSA-Crypto configuration file `tf-psa-crypto/include/psa/crypto_config.h`.

With the default platform options, Mbed TLS should build out of the box on most systems.

These configuration files can be edited manually, or programmatically using the Python 3 script `scripts/config.py` (run with --help for usage instructions).

We provide some non-standard configurations focused on specific use cases in the `configs/` directory. You can read more about those in `configs/README.txt`.

Documentation
-------------

The main Mbed TLS documentation is available via [ReadTheDocs](https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/).

To generate a local copy of the library documentation in HTML format, tailored to your compile-time configuration:

1. Make sure that [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) is installed.
1. Run `cmake -B /path/to/build_dir /path/to/mbedtls/source`
1. Run `cmake --build /path/to/build_dir --target mbedtls-apidoc`
1. Browse `apidoc/index.html` or `apidoc/modules.html`.

For other sources of documentation, see the [SUPPORT](SUPPORT.md) document.

Compiling
---------

We use CMake to configure and drive our build process. Three libraries are built: `libtfpsacrypto`, `libmbedx509`, and `libmbedtls`. Note that `libmbedtls` depends on `libmbedx509` and `libtfpsacrypto`, and `libmbedx509` depends on `libtfpsacrypto`. As a result, some linkers will expect flags to be in a specific order, for example the GNU linker wants `-lmbedtls -lmbedx509 -ltfpsacrypto`. The cryptographic library `libtfpsacrypto` is also provided under its legacy name, `libmbedcrypto`.

### Tool versions

You need the following tools to build the library from the main branch with the provided CMake files. Mbed TLS minimum tool version requirements are set based on the versions shipped in the latest or penultimate (depending on the release cadence) long-term support releases of major Linux distributions, namely at time of writing: Ubuntu 22.04, RHEL 9, and SLES 15 SP4.

* CMake 3.20.4 or later.
* A build system like Make or Ninja for which CMake can generate build files.
* A C99 toolchain (compiler, linker, archiver). We actively test with GCC 5.4, Clang 3.8, Arm Compiler 6, IAR 8 and Visual Studio 2017. More recent versions should work. Slightly older versions may work.
* Python 3.8 to generate the test code. Python is also needed to build the development branch (see next section).
* Perl to run the tests, and to generate some source files in the development branch.
* Doxygen 1.8.14 or later (if building the documentation; slightly older versions should work).

### Git usage

The `development` branch and the `mbedtls-3.6` long-term support branch of Mbed TLS use a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#_cloning_submodules) ([framework](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-framework)). This is not needed to merely compile the library at a release tag. This is not needed to consume a release archive (zip or tar).

### Generated source files in the development branch

The source code of Mbed TLS includes some files that are automatically generated by scripts and whose content depends only on the Mbed TLS source, not on the platform or on the library configuration. These files are not included in the development branch of Mbed TLS, but the generated files are included in official releases. This section explains how to generate the missing files in the development branch.

The following tools are required:

* Perl, for some library source files.
* Python 3 and some Python packages, for some library source files, sample programs and test data. To install the necessary packages, run:
    ```
    python3 -m pip install --user -r scripts/basic.requirements.txt
    ```
    Depending on your Python installation, you may need to invoke `python` instead of `python3`. To install the packages system-wide, omit the `--user` option.
* A C compiler for the host platform, for some test data.

The scripts that generate the configuration-independent files will look for a host C compiler in the following places (in order of preference):

1. The `HOSTCC` environment variable. This can be used if `CC` is pointing to a cross-compiler.
2. The `CC` environment variable.
3. An executable called `cc` in the current path.

Note: If you have multiple toolchains installed, it is recommended to set `CC` or `HOSTCC` to the intended host compiler before generating the files.

Any of the following methods are available to generate the configuration-independent files:

* On non-Windows systems, when not cross-compiling, CMake generates the required files automatically.
* Run `framework/scripts/make_generated_files.py` to generate all the configuration-independent files.

### CMake

In order to build the libraries using CMake in a separate directory (recommended), just enter at the command line:

    mkdir /path/to/build_dir && cd /path/to/build_dir
    cmake /path/to/mbedtls_source
    cmake --build .

In order to run the tests, enter:

    ctest

The test suites need Python to be built and Perl to be executed. If you don't have one of these installed, you'll want to disable the test suites with:

    cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=Off /path/to/mbedtls_source

If you disabled the test suites, but kept the programs enabled, you can still run a much smaller set of tests with:

    programs/test/selftest

To configure CMake for building shared libraries, use:

    cmake -DUSE_SHARED_MBEDTLS_LIBRARY=On /path/to/mbedtls_source

There are many different build types available with CMake. Most of them are available for gcc and clang, though some are compiler-specific:

-   `Release`. This generates the default code without any unnecessary information in the binary files.
-   `Debug`. This generates debug information and disables optimization of the code.
-   `Coverage`. This generates code coverage information in addition to debug information.
-   `ASan`. This instruments the code with AddressSanitizer to check for memory errors. (This includes LeakSanitizer, with recent version of gcc and clang.) (With recent version of clang, this mode also instruments the code with UndefinedSanitizer to check for undefined behaviour.)
-   `ASanDbg`. Same as ASan but slower, with debug information and better stack traces.
-   `MemSan`. This instruments the code with MemorySanitizer to check for uninitialised memory reads.
-   `MemSanDbg`. Same as MemSan but slower, with debug information, better stack traces and origin tracking.
-   `Check`. This activates the compiler warnings that depend on optimization and treats all warnings as errors.
-   `TSan`. This instruments the code with ThreadSanitizer to detect data races and other threading-related concurrency issues at runtime.
-   `TSanDbg`. Same as TSan but slower, with debug information, better stack traces and origin tracking.

Switching build types in CMake is simple. For debug mode, enter at the command line:

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/mbedtls_source

To list other available CMake options, use:

    cmake -LH

Note that, with CMake, you can't adjust the compiler or its flags after the
initial invocation of cmake. This means that `CC=your_cc make` and `make
CC=your_cc` will *not* work (similarly with `CFLAGS` and other variables).
These variables need to be adjusted when invoking cmake for the first time,
for example:

    CC=your_cc cmake /path/to/mbedtls_source

If you already invoked cmake and want to change those settings, you need to
remove the build directory and create it again.

Note that it is possible to build in-place; this will however overwrite the
legacy Makefiles still used for testing purposes (see
`scripts/tmp_ignore_makefiles.sh` if you want to prevent `git status` from
showing them as modified). In order to do so, from the Mbed TLS source
directory, use:

    cmake .
    cmake --build .

If you want to change `CC` or `CFLAGS` afterwards, you will need to remove the
CMake cache. This can be done with the following command using GNU find:

    find . -iname '*cmake*' -not -name CMakeLists.txt -exec rm -rf {} +

You can now make the desired change:

    CC=your_cc cmake .
    cmake --build .

Regarding variables, also note that if you set CFLAGS when invoking cmake,
your value of CFLAGS doesn't override the content provided by CMake (depending
on the build mode as seen above), it's merely prepended to it.

#### Consuming Mbed TLS

Mbed TLS provides a package config file for consumption as a dependency in other
CMake projects. You can include Mbed TLS's CMake targets yourself with:

    find_package(MbedTLS)

If prompted, set `MbedTLS_DIR` to `${YOUR_MBEDTLS_INSTALL_DIR}/cmake`. This
creates the following targets:

- `MbedTLS::tfpsacrypto` (Crypto library)
- `MbedTLS::mbedtls` (TLS library)
- `MbedTLS::mbedx509` (X509 library)

You can then use these directly through `target_link_libraries()`:

    add_executable(xyz)

    target_link_libraries(xyz
        PUBLIC MbedTLS::mbedtls
               MbedTLS::tfpsacrypto
               MbedTLS::mbedx509)

This will link the Mbed TLS libraries to your library or application, and add
its include directories to your target (transitively, in the case of `PUBLIC` or
`INTERFACE` link libraries).

#### Mbed TLS as a subproject

Mbed TLS supports being built as a CMake subproject. One can
use `add_subdirectory()` from a parent CMake project to include Mbed TLS as a
subproject.

Example programs
----------------

We've included example programs for a lot of different features and uses in [`programs/`](programs/README.md).
Please note that the goal of these sample programs is to demonstrate specific features of the library, and the code may need to be adapted to build a real-world application.

Tests
-----

Mbed TLS includes an elaborate test suite in `tests/` that initially requires Python to generate the tests files (e.g. `test_suite_ssl.c`). These files are generated from a `function file` (e.g. `suites/test_suite_ssl.function`) and a `data file` (e.g. `suites/test_suite_ssl.data`). The `function file` contains the test functions. The `data file` contains the test cases, specified as parameters that will be passed to the test function.

For machines with a Unix shell and OpenSSL (and optionally GnuTLS) installed, additional test scripts are available:

-   `tests/ssl-opt.sh` runs integration tests for various TLS options (renegotiation, resumption, etc.) and tests interoperability of these options with other implementations.
-   `tests/compat.sh` tests interoperability of every ciphersuite with other implementations.
-   `tests/scripts/depends.py` tests builds in configurations with a single curve, key exchange, hash, cipher, or pkalg on.
-   `tests/scripts/all.sh` runs a combination of the above tests, plus some more, with various build options (such as ASan, full `mbedtls_config.h`, etc).

Instead of manually installing the required versions of all tools required for testing, it is possible to use the Docker images from our CI systems, as explained in [our testing infrastructure repository](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-test/blob/main/README.md#quick-start).

Porting Mbed TLS
----------------

Mbed TLS can be ported to many different architectures, OS's and platforms. Before starting a port, you may find the following Knowledge Base articles useful:

-   [Porting Mbed TLS to a new environment or OS](https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kb/how-to/how-do-i-port-mbed-tls-to-a-new-environment-OS/)
-   [What external dependencies does Mbed TLS rely on?](https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kb/development/what-external-dependencies-does-mbedtls-rely-on/)
-   [How do I configure Mbed TLS](https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kb/compiling-and-building/how-do-i-configure-mbedtls/)

Mbed TLS is mostly written in portable C99; however, it has a few platform requirements that go beyond the standard, but are met by most modern architectures:

- Bytes must be 8 bits.
- All-bits-zero must be a valid representation of a null pointer.
- Signed integers must be represented using two's complement.
- `int` and `size_t` must be at least 32 bits wide.
- The types `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and their signed equivalents must be available.
- Mixed-endian platforms are not supported.
- SIZE_MAX must be at least as big as INT_MAX and UINT_MAX.
