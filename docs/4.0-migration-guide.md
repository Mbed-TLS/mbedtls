# Migrating from Mbed TLS 3.x to TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0

This guide details the steps required to migrate from Mbed TLS version 3.x to Mbed TLS version 4.0 or greater. Unlike normal releases, Mbed TLS 4.0 breaks compatibility with previous versions, so users, integrators and package maintainers might need to change their own code in order to make it work with Mbed TLS 4.0.

Here's the list of breaking changes; each entry should help you answer these two questions: (1) am I affected? (2) if yes, what's my migration path?

- Mbed TLS has been split between two products: TF-PSA-Crypto for cryptography, and Mbed TLS for X.509 and (D)TLS.
- CMake is now the only supported build system.
- The cryptography API is now mostly the PSA API: most legacy cryptography APIs have been removed. This has led to adaptations in some X.509 and TLS APIs, notably because the library always uses the PSA random generator.
- Various deprecated or minor functionality has been removed.

Please consult the [TF-PSA-Crypto migration guide](../tf-psa-crypto/docs/1.0-migration-guide.md) for all information related to the crytography part of the library.

## CMake as the only build system
Mbed TLS now uses CMake exclusively to configure and drive its build process.
Support for the GNU Make and Microsoft Visual Studio project-based build systems has been removed.

The previous `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files are no longer distributed or generated.

See the `Compiling` section in README.md for instructions on building the Mbed TLS libraries and tests with CMake.
If you develop in Microsoft Visual Studio, you could either generate a Visual Studio solution using a CMake generator, or open the CMake project directly in Visual Studio.

### Translating Make commands to CMake

With the removal of GNU Make support, all build, test, and installation operations must now be performed using CMake.
This section provides a quick reference for translating common `make` commands into their CMake equivalents.

#### Basic build workflow

Run `cmake -S . -B build` once before building to configure the build and generate native build files (e.g., Makefiles) in the `build` directory.
This sets up an out-of-tree build, which is recommended.

| Make command   | CMake equivalent                               | Description                                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make`         | `cmake --build build`                          | Build the libraries, programs, and tests in the `build` directory. |
| `make test`    | `ctest --test-dir build`                       | Run the tests produced by the previous build. |
| `make clean`   | `cmake --build build --target clean`           | Remove build artifacts produced by the previous build. |
| `make install` | `cmake --install build --prefix build/install` | Install the built libraries, headers, and tests to `build/install`. |

#### Building specific targets

Unless otherwise specified, the CMake command in the table below should be preceded by a `cmake -S . -B build` call to configure the build and generate build files in the `build` directory.

| Make command    | CMake equivalent                                                    | Description               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `make lib`      | `cmake --build build --target lib`                                  | Build only the libraries. |
| `make tests`    | `cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_PROGRAMS=Off && cmake --build build`  | Build test suites. |
| `make programs` | `cmake --build build --target programs`                             | Build example programs. |
| `make apidoc`   | `cmake --build build --target mbedtls-apidoc`                       | Build documentation. |

Target names may differ slightly; use `cmake --build build --target help` to list all available CMake targets.

There is no CMake equivalent for `make generated_files` or `make neat`.
Generated files are automatically created in the build tree with `cmake --build build` and removed with `cmake --build build --target clean`.
If you need to build the generated files in the source tree without involving CMake, you can call `framework/scripts/make_generated_files.py`.

There is currently no equivalent for `make uninstall` in the Mbed TLS CMake build system.

#### Common build options

The following table illustrates the approximate CMake equivalents of common make commands.
Most CMake examples show only the configuration step, others (like installation) correspond to different stages of the build process.

| Make usage                 | CMake usage                                           | Description          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `make DEBUG=1`             | `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`        | Build in debug mode. |
| `make SHARED=1`            | `cmake -S . -B build -DUSE_SHARED_MBEDTLS_LIBRARY=On` | Also build shared libraries. |
| `make GEN_FILES=""`        | `cmake -S . -B build -DGEN_FILES=OFF`                 | Skip generating files (not a strict equivalent). |
| `make DESTDIR=install_dir` | `cmake --install build --prefix install_dir`          | Specify installation path. |
| `make CC=clang`            | `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang`        | Set the compiler. |
| `make CFLAGS='-O2 -Wall'`  | `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O2 -Wall"`     | Set compiler flags. |

## Repository split
In Mbed TLS 4.0, the project was split into two repositories:
- [Mbed TLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls): provides TLS and X.509 functionality.
- [TF-PSA-Crypto](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/TF-PSA-Crypto): provides the standalone cryptography library, implementing the PSA Cryptography API.
Mbed TLS consumes TF-PSA-Crypto as a submodule.
You should stay with Mbed TLS if you use TLS or X.509 functionality. You still have direct access to the cryptography library.

### File and directory relocations

The following table summarizes the file and directory relocations resulting from the repository split between Mbed TLS and TF-PSA-Crypto.
These changes reflect the move of cryptographic, cryptographic-adjacent, and platform components from Mbed TLS into the new TF-PSA-Crypto repository.

| Original location                       | New location(s)                                                                      | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `library/*`  (<sup>†</sup>)             | `tf-psa-crypto/core/`<br>`tf-psa-crypto/drivers/builtin/src/`                        | Contains cryptographic, cryptographic-adjacent (e.g., ASN.1, Base64), and platform C modules and headers. |
| `include/mbedtls/*`  (<sup>†</sup>)     | `tf-psa-crypto/include/mbedtls/`<br>`tf-psa-crypto/drivers/builtin/include/private/` | Public headers moved to `include/mbedtls`; now internal headers moved to `include/private`. |
| `include/psa`                           | `tf-psa-crypto/include/psa`                                                          | All PSA headers consolidated here. |
| `3rdparty/everest`<br>`3rdparty/p256-m` | `tf-psa-crypto/drivers/everest`<br>`tf-psa-crypto/drivers/p256-m`                    | Third-party crypto driver implementations. |

(<sup>†</sup>) The `library` and `include/mbedtls` directories still exist in Mbed TLS, but now contain only TLS and X.509 components.

### Configuration file split
Cryptography and platform configuration options have been moved from `include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h` to `tf-psa-crypto/include/psa/crypto_config.h`, which is now mandatory.
See [Compile-time configuration](#compile-time-configuration).

The header `include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h` still exists and now contains only the TLS and X.509 configuration options.

If you use the Python script `scripts/config.py` to adjust your configuration, you do not need to modify your scripts to specify which configuration file to edit, the script automatically updates the correct file.

There have been significant changes in the configuration options, primarily affecting cryptography.

#### Cryptography configuration
- See [psa-transition.md](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/TF-PSA-Crypto/blob/development/docs/psa-transition.md#compile-time-configuration).
- See also the following sections in the TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0 migration guide:
  - *PSA as the Only Cryptography API* and its sub-section *Impact on the Library Configuration*
  - *Random Number Generation Configuration*

#### TLS configuration
For details about TLS-related changes, see [Changes to TLS options](#changes-to-tls-options).

### Impact on some usages of the library

#### Checking out a branch or a tag
After checking out a branch or tag of the Mbed TLS repository, you must now recursively update the submodules, as TF-PSA-Crypto contains itself a nested submodule:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Linking directly to a built library

The Mbed TLS CMake build system still provides the cryptography libraries under their legacy name, `libmbedcrypto.<ext>`, so you can continue linking against them.
These libraries are still located in the `library` directory within the build tree.

The cryptography libraries are also now provided as `libtfpsacrypto.<ext>`, consistent with the naming used in the TF-PSA-Crypto repository.

You may need to update include paths to the public header files, see [File and Directory Relocations](#file-and-directory-relocations) for details.

#### Using Mbed TLS as a CMake subproject

The base name of the libraries are now `tfpsacrypto` (formely `mbedcrypto`), `mbedx509` and `mbedtls`.
As before, these base names are also the names of CMake targets to build each library.
If your CMake scripts reference a cryptography library target, you need to update its name accordingly.

For example, the following CMake code:
```
target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE mbedcrypto)
```
should be updated to:
```
target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE tfpsacrypto)
```

You can refer to the following example demonstrating how to consume Mbed TLS as a CMake subproject:
- `programs/test/cmake_subproject`

#### Using Mbed TLS as a CMake package

The same renaming applies to the cryptography library targets declared as part of the Mbed TLS CMake package, use `MbedTLS::tfpsacrypto` instead of `MbedTLS::mbedcrypto`.

For example, the following CMake code:
```
find_package(MbedTLS REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE MbedTLS::mbedcrypto)
```
should be updated to:
```
find_package(MbedTLS REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE MbedTLS::tfpsacrypto)
```
You can also refer to the following example programs demonstrating how to consume Mbed TLS as a CMake package:
- `programs/test/cmake_package`
- `programs/test/cmake_package_install`

#### Using the Mbed TLS Crypto pkg-config file

The Mbed TLS CMake build system still provides the pkg-config file mbedcrypto.pc, so you can continue using it.
Internally, it now references the tfpsacrypto library.

A new pkg-config file, `tfpsacrypto.pc`, is also provided.
Both `mbedcrypto.pc` and `tfpsacrypto.pc` are functionally equivalent, providing the same compiler and linker flags.

#### Using Mbed TLS as an installed library

The Mbed TLS CMake build system still installs the cryptography libraries under their legacy name, `libmbedcrypto.<ext>`, so you can continue linking against them.
The cryptography library is also now provided as `libtfpsacrypto.<ext>`.

Regarding the headers, the main change is the relocation of some headers to subdirectories called `private`.
These headers are installed primarily to satisfy compiler dependencies.
Others remain for historical reasons and may be cleaned up in later versions of the library.

We strongly recommend not relying on the declarations in these headers, as they may be removed or modified without notice.
See the section Private Declarations in the TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0 migration guide for more information.

Finally, note the new `include/tf-psa-crypto` directory, which contains the TF-PSA-Crypto version and build-time configuration headers.

### Audience-Specific Notes

#### Application Developers using a distribution package
- See [Impact on usages of the library](#impact-on-some-usages-of-the-library) for the possible impacts on:
  - Linking against the cryptography library or CMake targets.
  - Using the Mbed TLS Crypto pkg-config file.
  - Using Mbed TLS as an installed library

### Developer or package maintainers
If you build or distribute Mbed TLS:
- The build system is now CMake only, Makefiles and Visual Studio projects are removed.
- You may need to adapt packaging scripts to handle the TF-PSA-Crypto submodule.
- You should update submodules recursively after checkout.
- Review [File and directory relocations](#file-and-directory-relocations) for updated paths.
- See [Impact on usages of the library](#impact-on-some-usages-of-the-library) for the possible impacts on:
  - Linking against the cryptography library or CMake targets.
  - Using the Mbed TLS Crypto pkg-config file (`mbedcrypto.pc` or `tfpsacrypto.pc`).
  - Using Mbed TLS as an installed library
- Configuration note: cryptography and platform options are now in `crypto_config.h` (see [Configuration file split](#configuration-file-split)).

### Platform Integrators
If you integrate Mbed TLS with a platform or hardware drivers:
- TF-PSA-Crypto is now a submodule, update integration scripts to initialize submodules recursively.
- The PSA driver wrapper is now generated in TF-PSA-Crypto.
- Platform-specific configuration are now handled in `crypto_config.h`.
- See [Repository split](#repository-split) for how platform components moved to TF-PSA-Crypto.

## Compile-time configuration

### Configuration file split

All configuration options that are relevant to TF-PSA-Crypto must now be configured in one of its configuration files, namely:

* `TF_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG_FILE`, if set on the preprocessor command line;
* otherwise `<psa/crypto_config.h>`;
* additionally `TF_PSA_CRYPTO_USER_CONFIG_FILE`, if set.

Configuration options that are relevant to X.509 or TLS should still be set in the Mbed TLS configuration file (`MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE` or `<mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h>`, plus `MBEDTLS_USER_CONFIG_FILE` if it is set). However, you can define all options in the crypto configuration, and Mbed TLS will pick them up.

Generally speaking, the options that must be configured in TF-PSA-Crypto are:

* options related to platform settings;
* options related to the choice of cryptographic mechanisms included in the build;
* options related to the inner workings of cryptographic mechanisms, such as size/memory/performance compromises;
* options related to crypto-adjacent features, such as ASN.1 and Base64.

See `include/psa/crypto_config.h` in TF-PSA-Crypto and `include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h` in Mbed TLS for details.

Notably, `<psa/crypto_config.h>` is no longer limited to `PSA_WANT_xxx` options.

Note that many options related to cryptography have changed; see the TF-PSA-Crypto migration guide for details.

### Split of `build_info.h` and `version.h`

The header file `<mbedtls/build_info.h>`, which includes the configuration file and provides the adjusted configuration macros, now has an similar file `<tf-psa-crypto/build_info.h>` in TF-PSA-Crypto. The Mbed TLS header includes the TF-PSA-Crypto header, so including `<mbedtls/build_info.h>` remains sufficient to obtain information about the crypto configuration.

TF-PSA-Crypto exposes its version through `<tf-psa-crypto/version.h>`, similar to `<mbedtls/version.h>` in Mbed TLS.

### Removal of `check_config.h`

The header `mbedtls/check_config.h` is no longer present. Including it from user configuration files was already obsolete in Mbed TLS 3.x, since it enforces properties the configuration as adjusted by `mbedtls/build_info.h`, not properties that the user configuration is expected to meet.

### Changes to TLS options

#### Enabling null cipher suites

The option to enable null cipher suites in TLS 1.2 has been renamed from `MBEDTLS_CIPHER_NULL_CIPHER` to `MBEDTLS_SSL_NULL_CIPHERSUITES`. It remains disabled in the default configuration.

#### Removal of backward compatibility options

The option `MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CONNECTION_ID_COMPAT` has been removed. Only the version standardized in RFC 9146 is supported now.

## PSA as the only cryptography API

The PSA API is now the only API for cryptographic primitives.

### Impact on application code

The X.509, PKCS7 and SSL modules always use PSA for cryptography, with a few exceptions documented in the [PSA limitations](architecture/psa-migration/psa-limitations.md) document. (These limitations are mostly transparent unless you want to leverage PSA accelerator drivers.) This corresponds to the behavior of Mbed TLS 3.x when `MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO` is enabled. In effect, `MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO` is now always enabled.

`psa_crypto_init()` must be called before performing any cryptographic operation, including indirect requests such as parsing a key or certificate or starting a TLS handshake.

A few functions take different parameters to migrate them to the PSA API. See “[Function prototype changes](#function-prototype-changes)”.

### No random generator instantiation

Formerly, applications using TLS, asymmetric cryptography operations involving a private key, or other features needing random numbers, needed to provide a random generator, generally by instantiating an entropy context (`mbedtls_entropy_context`) and a DRBG context (`mbedtls_ctr_drbg_context` or `mbedtls_hmac_drbg_context`). This is no longer necessary, or possible. All features that require a random generator (RNG) now use the one provided by the PSA subsystem.

Instead, applications that use random generators or keys (even public keys) need to call `psa_crypto_init()` before any cryptographic operation or key management operation.

See also [function prototype changes](#function-prototype-changes), many of which are related to the move from RNG callbacks to a global RNG.

### Impact on the library configuration

Mbed TLS follows the configuration of TF-PSA-Crypto with respect to cryptographic mechanisms. They are now based on `PSA_WANT_xxx` macros instead of legacy configuration macros such as `MBEDTLS_RSA_C`, `MBEDTLS_PKCS1_V15`, etc. The configuration of X.509 and TLS is not directly affected by the configuration. However, applications and middleware that rely on these configuration symbols to know which cryptographic mechanisms to support will need to migrate to `PSA_WANT_xxx` macros. For more information, consult the PSA transition guide in TF-PSA-Crypto.

## Private declarations

Since Mbed TLS 3.0, some things that are declared in a public header are not part of the stable application programming interface (API), but instead are considered private. Private elements may be removed or may have their semantics changed in a future minor release without notice.

### Understanding private declarations in public headers

In Mbed TLS 4.x, private elements in header files include:

* Anything appearing in a header file whose path contains `/private` (unless re-exported and documented in another non-private header).
* Structure and union fields declared with `MBEDTLS_PRIVATE(field_name)` in the source code, and appearing as `private_field_name` in the rendered documentation. (This was already the case since Mbed TLS 3.0.)
* Any preprocessor macro that is not documented with a Doxygen comment.
  In the source code, Doxygen comments start with `/**` or `/*!`. If a macro only has a comment above that starts with `/*`, the macro is considered private.
  In the rendered documentation, private macros appear with only an automatically rendered parameter list, value and location, but no custom text.
* Any declaration that is guarded by the preprocessor macro `MBEDTLS_DECLARE_PRIVATE_IDENTIFIERS`.

### Usage of private declarations

Some private declarations are present in public headers for technical reasons, because they need to be visible to the compiler. Others are present for historical reasons and may be cleaned up in later versions of the library. We strongly recommend against relying on these declarations, since they may be removed or may have their semantics changed without notice.

Note that Mbed TLS 4.0 still relies on some private interfaces of TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0. We expect to remove this reliance gradually in future minor releases.

Sample programs have not been fully updated yet and some of them might still
use APIs that are no longer public. You can recognize them by the fact that they
define the macro `MBEDTLS_DECLARE_PRIVATE_IDENTIFIERS` (or
`MBEDTLS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ACCESS`) at the very top (before including headers). When
you see one of these two macros in a sample program, be aware it has not been
updated and parts of it do not demonstrate current practice.

We strongly recommend against defining `MBEDTLS_DECLARE_PRIVATE_IDENTIFIERS` or
`MBEDTLS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ACCESS` in your own application. If you do so, your code
may not compile or work with future minor releases. If there's something you
want to do that you feel can only be achieved by using one of these two macros,
please reach out on github or the mailing list.

## Error codes

### Unified error code space

The convention still applies that functions return 0 for success and a negative value between -32767 and -1 on error. PSA functions (`psa_xxx()` or `mbedtls_psa_xxx()`) still return a `PSA_ERROR_xxx` error codes. Non-PSA functions (`mbedtls_xxx()` excluding `mbedtls_psa_xxx()`) can return either `PSA_ERROR_xxx` or `MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx` error codes.

There may be cases where an `MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx` constant has the same numerical value as a `PSA_ERROR_xxx`. In such cases, they have the same meaning: they are different names for the same error condition.

### Simplified legacy error codes

All values returned by a function to indicate an error now have a defined constant named `MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx` or `PSA_ERROR_xxx`. Functions no longer return the sum of a “low-level” and a “high-level” error code.

Generally, functions that used to return the sum of two error codes now return the low-level code. However, as before, the exact error code returned in a given scenario can change without notice unless the condition is specifically described in the function's documentation and no other condition is applicable.

As a consequence, the functions `mbedtls_low_level_strerr()` and `mbedtls_high_level_strerr()` no longer exist.

### Removed error code names

Many legacy error codes have been removed in favor of PSA error codes. Generally, functions that returned a legacy error code in the table below in Mbed TLS 3.6 now return the PSA error code listed on the same row. Similarly, callbacks should apply the same changes to error code, unless there has been a relevant change to the callback's interface.

| Legacy constant (Mbed TLS 3.6)          | PSA constant (Mbed TLS 4.0)     |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED` | `PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED` |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_ERROR_GENERIC_ERROR`       | `PSA_ERROR_GENERIC_ERROR`       |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_NET_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`      | `PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`    |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_OID_BUF_TOO_SMALL`         | `PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`    |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_OID_NOT_FOUND`             | `PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`       |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_PKCS7_ALLOC_FAILED`        | `PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY` |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_PKCS7_BAD_INPUT_DATA`      | `PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_PKCS7_VERIFY_FAIL`         | `PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`   |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_ALLOC_FAILED`          | `PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY` |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BAD_INPUT_DATA`        | `PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`      | `PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`    |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_X509_ALLOC_FAILED`         | `PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY` |
| `MBEDTLS_ERR_X509_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`     | `PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`    |

See also the corresponding section in the TF-PSA-Crypto migration guide, which lists error codes from cryptography modules.

## Removal of deprecated functions

### Removal of deprecated X.509 functions

The deprecated function `mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial()` has been removed. The function was superseded by `mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial_raw()`.

### Removal of deprecated SSL functions

The deprecated function `mbedtls_ssl_conf_curves()` has been removed.
The function was superseded by `mbedtls_ssl_conf_groups()`.

### Removal of `compat-2.x.h`

The header `compat-2.x.h`, containing some definitions for backward compatibility with Mbed TLS 2.x, has been removed.

## Removed features

### Removal of obsolete key exchanges methods in (D)TLS 1.2

Mbed TLS 4.0 no longer supports key exchange methods that rely on finite-field Diffie-Hellman (DHE) in TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2. (Only ephemeral Diffie-Hellman was ever supported, Mbed TLS 3.x already did not support static Diffie-Hellman.) Finite-field Diffie-Hellman remains supported in TLS 1.3.

Mbed TLS 4.0 no longer supports key exchange methods that rely on RSA decryption (without forward secrecy). RSA signatures remain supported. This affects TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2 (TLS 1.3 does not have key exchanges using RSA decryption).

That is, the following key exchange types are no longer supported:

* RSA-PSK;
* RSA (i.e. cipher suites using only RSA decryption: cipher suites using RSA signatures remain supported);
* DHE-PSK (except in TLS 1.3);
* DHE-RSA (except in TLS 1.3).
* static ECDH (ECDH-RSA and ECDH-ECDSA, as opposed to ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE) which remains supported).

The full list of removed cipher suites is:

As a consequence of the removal of support for DHE in (D)TLS 1.2, the following functions are no longer useful and have been removed:

```
mbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param_bin()
mbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param_ctx()
mbedtls_ssl_conf_dhm_min_bitlen()
```

### Removal of elliptic curves

Following their removal from the crypto library, elliptic curves of less than 250 bits (secp192r1, secp192k1, secp224r1, secp224k1) are no longer supported in certificates and in TLS.

### Removal of deprecated functions

The deprecated functions `mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_version()` and `mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_version()`, and the associated constants `MBEDTLS_SSL_MAJOR_VERSION_3`, `MBEDTLS_SSL_MINOR_VERSION_3` and `MBEDTLS_SSL_MINOR_VERSION_4` have been removed. Use `mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_tls_version()` and `mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_tls_version()` with `MBEDTLS_SSL_VERSION_TLS1_2` or `MBEDTLS_SSL_VERSION_TLS1_3` instead.

The deprecated function `mbedtls_ssl_conf_sig_hashes()` has been removed. Use `mbedtls_ssl_conf_sig_algs()` instead.

## Function prototype changes

A number of existing functions now take a different list of arguments, mostly to migrate them to the PSA API.

### Public functions no longer take a RNG callback

Functions that need randomness no longer take an RNG callback in the form of `f_rng, p_rng` arguments. Instead, they use the PSA Crypto random generator (accessible as `psa_generate_random()`). All software using the X.509 or SSL modules must call `psa_crypto_init()` before calling any of the functions listed here.

### RNG removal in X.509

The following function prototypes have been changed in `mbedtls/x509_crt.h`:

```c
int mbedtls_x509write_crt_der(mbedtls_x509write_cert *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size,
                              int (*f_rng)(void *, unsigned char *, size_t),
                              void *p_rng);

int mbedtls_x509write_crt_pem(mbedtls_x509write_cert *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size,
                              int (*f_rng)(void *, unsigned char *, size_t),
                              void *p_rng);
```

to

```c
int mbedtls_x509write_crt_der(mbedtls_x509write_cert *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size);

int mbedtls_x509write_crt_pem(mbedtls_x509write_cert *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size);
```

The following function prototypes have been changed in `mbedtls/x509_csr.h`:
```c
int mbedtls_x509write_csr_der(mbedtls_x509write_csr *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size,
                              int (*f_rng)(void *, unsigned char *, size_t),
                              void *p_rng);

int mbedtls_x509write_csr_pem(mbedtls_x509write_csr *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size,
                              int (*f_rng)(void *, unsigned char *, size_t),
                              void *p_rng);
```

to

```c
int mbedtls_x509write_csr_der(mbedtls_x509write_csr *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size);

int mbedtls_x509write_csr_pem(mbedtls_x509write_csr *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t size);
```

### RNG removal in SSL

The following function prototype has been changed in `mbedtls/ssl_cookie.h`:

```c
int mbedtls_ssl_cookie_setup(mbedtls_ssl_cookie_ctx *ctx,
                             int (*f_rng)(void *, unsigned char *, size_t),
                             void *p_rng);
```

to

```c
int mbedtls_ssl_cookie_setup(mbedtls_ssl_cookie_ctx *ctx);
```

### Removal of `mbedtls_ssl_conf_rng`

`mbedtls_ssl_conf_rng()` has been removed from the library. Its sole purpose was to configure the RNG used for TLS, but now the PSA Crypto random generator is used throughout the library.

### Changes to mbedtls_ssl_ticket_setup

In the arguments of the function `mbedtls_ssl_ticket_setup()`, the `mbedtls_cipher_type_t` argument specifying the AEAD mechanism for ticket protection has been replaced by an equivalent PSA description consisting of a key type, a size and an algorithm. Also, the function no longer takes RNG arguments.

The prototype in `mbedtls/ssl_ticket.h` has changed from

```c
int mbedtls_ssl_ticket_setup(mbedtls_ssl_ticket_context *ctx,
                             mbedtls_f_rng_t *f_rng, void *p_rng,
                             mbedtls_cipher_type_t cipher,
                             uint32_t lifetime);
```

to

```c
int mbedtls_ssl_ticket_setup(mbedtls_ssl_ticket_context *ctx,
                             psa_algorithm_t alg, psa_key_type_t key_type, psa_key_bits_t key_bits,
                             uint32_t lifetime);
```

## OID module

The compilation option `MBEDTLS_OID_C` no longer exists. OID tables are included in the build automatically as needed for parsing and writing X.509 data.

Mbed TLS no longer offers interfaces to look up values by OID or OID by enum values (`mbedtls_oid_get_<thing>()` and `mbedtls_oid_get_oid_by_<thing>()`).

The header `<mbedtls/oid.h>` now only provides functions to convert between binary and dotted string OID representations. These functions are now part of `libmbedx509` rather than the crypto library. The function `mbedtls_oid_get_numeric_string()` is guarded by `MBEDTLS_X509_USE_C`, and `mbedtls_oid_from_numeric_string()` by `MBEDTLS_X509_CREATE_C`. The header also still defines macros for OID strings that are relevant to X.509.
