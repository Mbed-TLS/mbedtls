/**
 * @mainpage Mbed TLS v4.0.0 API Documentation
 *
 * This documentation describes the application programming interface (API)
 * of Mbed TLS.
 * It was automatically generated from specially formatted comment blocks in
 * Mbed TLS's source code using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl).
 *
 * ## Main entry points
 *
 * You can explore the full API from the “Files” or “Files list” section.
 * Locate the header file for the module that you are interested in and
 * explore its contents.
 *
 * Some parts of the API are best explored from the “Topics” or
 * “Group list” section.
 * This is notable the case for the PSA Cryptography API.
 * Note that many parts of the API are not classified under a topic and
 * can only be seen through the file structure.
 *
 * For information on configuring the library at compile time, see the
 * configuration header files mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h and
 * psa/crypto_config.h.
