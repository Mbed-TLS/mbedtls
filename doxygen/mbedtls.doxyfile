# We mostly use \retval declarations to document which error codes a function
# can return. The reader can follow the hyperlink to the definition of the
# constant to get the generic documentation of that error code. If we don't
# have anything to say about the specific error code for the specific
# function, we can leave the description part of the \retval command blank.
# This is perfectly valid as far as Doxygen is concerned. However, with
# Clang >=15, the -Wdocumentation option emits a warning for empty
# descriptions.

# As a workaround, you can write something like
#     \retval #PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY \emptydescription
# This avoids writing redundant text and keeps Clang happy.
