 *
 * Used in:
 *      include/mbedtls/bignum.h
 *      library/bignum.c
 *
 * The bignum code uses double-width division to speed up some operations.
 * Double-width division is often implemented in software that needs to
 * be linked with the program. The presence of a double-width integer
 * type is usually detected automatically through preprocessor macros,
 * but the automatic detection cannot know whether the code needs to
 * and can be linked with an implementation of division for that type.
 * By default division is assumed to be usable if the type is present.
 * Uncomment this option to prevent the use of double-width division.
 *
 * Note that division for the native integer type is always required.
 * Furthermore, a 64-bit type is always required even on a 32-bit
 * platform, but it need not support multiplication or division. In some
 * cases it is also desirable to disable some double-width operations. For
 * example, if double-width division is implemented in software, disabling

 * Some parts of the library may use multiplication of two unsigned 32-bit

 * removes the dependency of that library on platforms that lack a hardware

 * #MBEDTLS_ERR_ECP_IN_PROGRESS (or, for functions in the SSL module,
 * #MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_CRYPTO_IN_PROGRESS) and then be called later again in
 * order to further progress and eventually complete their operation. This is
 * controlled through mbedtls_ecp_set_max_ops() which limits the maximum
 * number of ECC operations a function may perform before pausing; see
 * mbedtls_ecp_set_max_ops() for more information.
 *
 * This is useful in non-threaded environments if you want to avoid blocking
 * for too long on ECC (and, hence, X.509 or SSL/TLS) operations.
 *
 * This option:
 * - Adds xxx_restartable() variants of existing operations in the
 *   following modules, with corresponding restart context types:
 *   - ECP (for Short Weierstrass curves only): scalar multiplication (mul),
 *     linear combination (muladd);
 *   - ECDSA: signature generation & verification;
 *   - PK: signature generation & verification;
 *   - X509: certificate chain verification.
 * - Adds mbedtls_ecdh_enable_restart() in the ECDH module.
 * - Changes the behaviour of TLS 1.2 clients (not servers) when using the
 *   ECDHE-ECDSA key exchange (not other key exchanges) to make all ECC
 *   computations restartable:
 *   - verification of the server's key exchange signature;
 *   - verification of the server's certificate chain;
 *   - generation of the client's signature if client authentication is used,
 *     with an ECC key/certificate.
 *
 * \note  In the cases above, the usual SSL/TLS functions, such as
 *        mbedtls_ssl_handshake(), can now return
 *        MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_CRYPTO_IN_PROGRESS.
 *
 * \note  When this option is enabled, restartable operations in PK, X.509
 *        and TLS (see above) are not using PSA. On the other hand, ECDH
 *        computations in TLS are using PSA, and are not restartable. These
 *        are temporary limitations that should be lifted in the future. (See
