 * To disable a cryptographic mechanism, comment out the definition of
 * the corresponding \c PSA_WANT_xxx preprocessor symbol.
 * The names of cryptographic mechanisms correspond to values
 * defined in psa/crypto_values.h, with the prefix \c PSA_WANT_ instead
 * of \c PSA_.
 *
 * Note that many cryptographic mechanisms involve two symbols: one for
 * the key type (\c PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_xxx) and one for the algorithm
 * (\c PSA_WANT_ALG_xxx). Mechanisms with additional parameters may involve
 * additional symbols.
