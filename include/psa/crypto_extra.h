/**
 * \brief Inject an initial entropy seed for the random generator into
 *        secure storage.
 *
 * This function injects data to be used as a seed for the random generator
 * used by the PSA Crypto implementation. On devices that lack a trusted
 * entropy source (preferably a hardware random number generator),
 * the Mbed PSA Crypto implementation uses this value to seed its
 * random generator.
 *
 * On devices without a trusted entropy source, this function must be
 * called exactly once in the lifetime of the device. On devices with
 * a trusted entropy source, calling this function is optional.
 * In all cases, this function may only be called before calling any
 * other function in the PSA Crypto API, including psa_crypto_init().
 *
 * When this function returns successfully, it populates a file in
 * persistent storage. Once the file has been created, this function
 * can no longer succeed.
 *
 * If any error occurs, this function does not change the system state.
 * You can call this function again after correcting the reason for the
 * error if possible.
 *
 * \warning This function **can** fail! Callers MUST check the return status.
 *
 * \warning If you use this function, you should use it as part of a
 *          factory provisioning process. The value of the injected seed
 *          is critical to the security of the device. It must be
 *          *secret*, *unpredictable* and (statistically) *unique per device*.
 *          You should be generate it randomly using a cryptographically
 *          secure random generator seeded from trusted entropy sources.
 *          You should transmit it securely to the device and ensure
 *          that its value is not leaked or stored anywhere beyond the
 *          needs of transmitting it from the point of generation to
 *          the call of this function, and erase all copies of the value
 *          once this function returns.
 *
 * This is an Mbed TLS extension.
 *
 * \note This function is only available on the following platforms:
 * * If the compile-time options MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_NV_SEED and
 *   MBEDTLS_PSA_HAS_ITS_IO are both enabled. Note that you
 *   must provide compatible implementations of mbedtls_nv_seed_read
 *   and mbedtls_nv_seed_write.
 * * In a client-server integration of PSA Cryptography, on the client side,
 *   if the server supports this feature.
 * \param[in] seed          Buffer containing the seed value to inject.
 * \param[in] seed_size     Size of the \p seed buffer.
 *                          The size of the seed in bytes must be greater
 *                          or equal to both #MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MIN_PLATFORM
 *                          and #MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_BLOCK_SIZE.
 *                          It must be less or equal to
 *                          #MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MAX_SEED_SIZE.
 *
 * \retval #PSA_SUCCESS
 *         The seed value was injected successfully. The random generator
 *         of the PSA Crypto implementation is now ready for use.
 *         You may now call psa_crypto_init() and use the PSA Crypto
 *         implementation.
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
 *         \p seed_size is out of range.
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
 * \retval `PSA_ITS_ERROR_XXX`
 *         There was a failure reading or writing from storage.
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
 *         The library has already been initialized. It is no longer
 *         possible to call this function.

/** Set up a key derivation operation.
 *
 * FIMXE This function is no longer part of the official API. Its prototype
 * is only kept around for the sake of tests that haven't been updated yet.
 *
 * A key derivation algorithm takes three inputs: a secret input \p key and
 * two non-secret inputs \p label and p salt.
 * The result of this function is a byte generator which can
 * be used to produce keys and other cryptographic material.
 *
 * The role of \p label and \p salt is as follows:
 * - For HKDF (#PSA_ALG_HKDF), \p salt is the salt used in the "extract" step
 *   and \p label is the info string used in the "expand" step.
 *
 * \param[in,out] generator       The generator object to set up. It must have
 *                                been initialized as per the documentation for
 *                                #psa_crypto_generator_t and not yet in use.
 * \param handle                  Handle to the secret key.
 * \param alg                     The key derivation algorithm to compute
 *                                (\c PSA_ALG_XXX value such that
 *                                #PSA_ALG_IS_KEY_DERIVATION(\p alg) is true).
 * \param[in] salt                Salt to use.
 * \param salt_length             Size of the \p salt buffer in bytes.
 * \param[in] label               Label to use.
 * \param label_length            Size of the \p label buffer in bytes.
 * \param capacity                The maximum number of bytes that the
 *                                generator will be able to provide.
 *
 * \retval #PSA_SUCCESS
 *         Success.
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_EMPTY_SLOT
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
 *         \c key is not compatible with \c alg,
 *         or \p capacity is too large for the specified algorithm and key.
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
 *         \c alg is not supported or is not a key derivation algorithm.
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_HARDWARE_FAILURE
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_TAMPERING_DETECTED
 * \retval #PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
 *         The library has not been previously initialized by psa_crypto_init().
 *         It is implementation-dependent whether a failure to initialize
 *         results in this error code.
