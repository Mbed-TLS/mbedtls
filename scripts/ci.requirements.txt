# Use a version of mypy that is compatible with our code base.
# mypy <0.940 is known not to work: see commit

# >=35.0.0 also requires Rust to build from source, which we are forced to do on
# FreeBSD, since PyPI doesn't carry binary wheels for the BSDs.
# Disable on FreeBSD until we get a Rust toolchain up and running on the CI.
