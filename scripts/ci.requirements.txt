# Use a known version of Pylint, because new versions tend to add warnings
# that could start rejecting our code.
# 2.13.9 is the last version that supports Python 3.6.
pylint == 2.13.9

# mypy 0.971 is the last version that supports Python 3.6.
mypy >= 0.971

# At the time of writing, only needed for tests/scripts/audit-validity-dates.py.
# It needs >=35.0.0 for correct operation, and that requires Python >=3.6,
# but our CI has Python 3.5. So let pip install the newest version that's
# compatible with the running Python: this way we get something good enough
# for mypy and pylint under Python 3.5, and we also get something good enough
# to run audit-validity-dates.py on Python >=3.6.
cryptography # >= 35.0.0
