# Use a known version of Pylint, because new versions tend to add warnings
# that could start rejecting our code.
# 2.4.4 is the version in Ubuntu 20.04. It supports Python >=3.5.
pylint == 2.4.4

# Use the last version of mypy that is compatible with Python 3.6.
# Newer versions should be ok too.
mypy >= 0.971

# At the time of writing, only needed for tests/scripts/audit-validity-dates.py.
# It needs >=35.0.0 for correct operation, and that requires Python >=3.6,
# but our CI has Python 3.5. So let pip install the newest version that's
# compatible with the running Python: this way we get something good enough
# for mypy and pylint under Python 3.5, and we also get something good enough
# to run audit-validity-dates.py on Python >=3.6.
cryptography # >= 35.0.0
