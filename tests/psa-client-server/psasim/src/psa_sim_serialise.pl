 * Each serialised buffer starts with a version byte, bytes that indicate
 * the size of basic C types, and four bytes that indicate the endianness
 * (to avoid incompatibilities if we ever run this over a network - we are
 * not aiming for universality, just for correctness and simplicity).
 *
 * Most types are serialised as a fixed-size (per type) octet string, with
 * no type indication. This is acceptable as (a) this is for the test PSA crypto
 * simulator only, not production, and (b) these functions are called by
 * code that itself is written by script.
 *
 * We also want to keep serialised data reasonably compact as communication
 * between client and server goes in messages of less than 200 bytes each.
 *
 * Many serialisation functions can be created by a script; an exemplar Perl
 * script is included. It is not hooked into the build and so must be run
 * manually, but is expected to be replaced by a Python script in due course.
 * Types that can have their functions created by script include plain old C
 * data types (e.g. int), types typedef'd to those, and even structures that
 * don't contain pointers.
