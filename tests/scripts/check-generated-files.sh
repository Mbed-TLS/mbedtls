default the scripts reports it and exits in error; with the -u option, it just
updates them instead.

# Note: if the format of calls to the "check" function changes, update

# Note: Instructions to generate those files are replicated in:
#   - **/Makefile (to (re)build them with make)
#   - **/CMakeLists.txt (to (re)build them with cmake)
#   - scripts/make_generated_files.bat (to generate them under Windows)
