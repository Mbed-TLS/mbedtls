"""Run the PSA Crypto API compliance test suite.

Clone the repo and check out the commit specified by PSA_ARCH_TEST_REPO and PSA_ARCH_TEST_REF,
then compile and run the test suite. The clone is stored at <repository root>/psa-arch-tests.
Known defects in either the test suite or TF-PSA-Crypto - identified by their test
number - are ignored, while unexpected failures AND successes are reported as errors, to help
keep the list of known defects as up to date as possible.
