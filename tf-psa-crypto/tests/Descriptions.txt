test_suites
    The various 'test_suite_XXX' programs from the 'tests' directory, executed
    using 'make check' (Unix make) or 'make test' (Cmake), include test cases
    (reference test vectors, sanity checks, malformed input for parsing
    functions, etc.) for all modules except the SSL modules.
